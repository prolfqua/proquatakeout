<!--### Filters-->

```{r}

# You don't need this second filter now
#filter_select("owner", "Comparsion type owner:", shared_pep, ~comparison)

# Volcano Plots

### Protein Volcano

```{r}

filter_select("comparison", "Comparison :", shared_prot, ~comparison)
plot_ly(shared_prot, x = ~fc, y = ~ I(-log10(pval)) , type="scatter" , mode="markers", text=~prot) %>% highlight("plotly_click")

```

### Peptide Volcano

```{r}
plot_ly(data=shared_pep, x = ~fc, y = ~ I(-log10(pval)),  mode="markers", type="scatter", text=~prot_pep)

```

##

### Proteins

```{r}
DT::datatable(shared_prot)
```

### Peptides
